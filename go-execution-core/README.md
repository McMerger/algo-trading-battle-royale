# Go Execution Core

## High-Performance Execution Layer

This module provides ultra-fast trade execution infrastructure built in Go, designed for low-latency algorithmic trading.

### Key Components

- **Real-time Trade Execution Engine**: Sub-millisecond order processing
- **REST/gRPC APIs**: Integration with Python strategy engines
- **Market Data Ingestion**: Real-time feed processing with goroutines
- **Order Management**: Concurrent order lifecycle management
- **Risk Controls**: Real-time position and exposure monitoring
- **Fill Simulation**: Configurable latency and slippage modeling

### Performance Features

- **Concurrent Processing**: Leverages Go's goroutines and channels
- **Memory Efficiency**: Zero-allocation hot paths for critical operations
- **Network Optimization**: Connection pooling and persistent connections
- **Monitoring Integration**: Prometheus metrics and structured logging
- **Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breakers and graceful degradation

### Quick Start

```bash
cd go-execution-core
go mod download
go build -o execution-engine ./cmd/main.go
./execution-engine
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/orders` - Submit new orders
- `GET /api/v1/orders/{id}` - Order status
- `DELETE /api/v1/orders/{id}` - Cancel orders
- `GET /api/v1/positions` - Current positions
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Health check

### Configuration

The execution engine supports environment-based configuration for deployment flexibility across development, staging, and production environments.
